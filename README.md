# Note to GitHub staff:
this is not any original code, it is made from a YouTube tutorial series.

# Note from Oppy who just saw this
Thank you, i deleted my old copy and found this. The previous note isn't entirely wrong. A good chunk is version of Eric Golde's youtube tutorial. A few minor sections were handmade or moddifed from the original tutorial. Anyways, thanks for this i rly need my old code.
